# AutoCompleteTextViewExample

Added basic practical example for auto complete text view
- If you want to get suggestions, when you type in an editable text field, you can do this via AutoCompleteTextView. 
It provides suggestions automatically when the user is typing
- So basically it is a view that is similar to EditText, except that it shows a list of completion suggestions automatically while the user is typing. 
The list of suggestions is displayed in drop down menu.

Two important XML atrributes :
- android:completionHint	Defines the hint displayed in the drop down menu.
- android:completionThreshold	Defines the number of characters that the user must type before completion suggestions are displayed in a drop down menu.
